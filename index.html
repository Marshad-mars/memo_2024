                        Hello world! "Remember 24!".It was a great season! It is not appropriate to say the 2024 season a trash.
                        According to some other peoples, they say it was a bad season and was completely trash but it is not like this.
                        If it was really bad then it is not meant to say the word at the moment of New year.Time changes men, if we
                        not learn to respect time then time also would not respect us which means our nature would be like that we
                        do not get the time to do this and do this etc...and would constantly say that 'we are not having time'.
                        This is the consequence of not respecting time!

                    ~This web-site's idea was inspired by my school's senior Math teacher, <b>Hafizur Islam Mazumdar</b>.He teaches standerd 9 and 10.But he also sometimes teaches
                    us computer.One day he was teaching us about the HTML and told that <strong>"storing our memories by making web-sites would be better compared to show and store them at facebook, instagram or any others."</strong>
                    And I thought that it would be better for me to make my first web-site as a project, learn more about web-programming and store them as what I wanted it to be!
                    My elder brother made me to start this, and after that i was getting interested, which convinced me to learn more about web-programming and finish this project one day.
